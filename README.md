## RGB led

Project for controlling RGB led using Arduino UNO PWM outputs.

<a id="Morse-code-transmitter"></a>

Morse code transmitter implemented in Arduino. The text message can be customized in the script. The circuit outputs the morse encoded message using both an RGB led and an active buzzer.

<a id="Light-based-theremin"></a>

## Light based theremin

A light based theremin implemented on Arduino UNO with a photoresistor (also called **photocell** or **light-dependent resistor (LDR)**) and an active buzzer.

<a id="Morse-code-transmitter"></a>

## Morse code transmitter

Morse code transmitter implemented in Arduino. The text message can be configured in the ***morse.ino*** script. The circuit outputs the morse encoded message using both an RGB led and an active buzzer.

<a id="Sine-wave-model"></a>

## Sine wave model

This project consists of training a model that predicts values of the $\sin(x)$ function using TensorFlow. Then, using TensorFlow Lite to convert this model and running the converted model on an **Arduino Nano** board, using the resulting simulated function to control a blinking LED.
